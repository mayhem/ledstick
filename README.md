Das Blinkenstick
================

This repo contains the software for my LED Stick POV project. 

In the driver directory you can find a script to convert images to C .h header files
that can be included in the Arduino C code so the images get uploaded to the Due's
program memory.

Upload the sketch and run it!

This code is setup for a 144 pixel NeoPixel strand of WS2811 led chips. Fun!
